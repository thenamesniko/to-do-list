## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

It has a Content License. This means you:

You cannot sell or distribute the Content (either in digital or physical form) on a Standalone basis. This includes selling or distributing Content on a Standalone basis as an image, audio, video, NFT or other digital file (including through a stock media platform), as well as a print, wallpaper, poster or on merchandise or on other physical products.

When we refer to "Standalone" we mean where no creative effort has been applied to the Content and it remains in substantially the same form as it exists on the Services. To help illustrate this, here are some examples:

-using the Content in its original form or solely using a filter, changing colors, resizing or cropping the Content remains Standalone use. -using the Content with a combination of images, videos, audio files, other media, text, illustrations, background features and editing techniques is not Standalone use, so long as the combined effect is to make a "new" creative work.

-If Content depicts any trademarks, logos or brands (whether two- or three-dimensional), you cannot use that Content for commercial purposes in relation to goods and services, in particular not print that Content on merchandise or other physical products for sale.

-You cannot use Content in any immoral or illegal way, especially Content which features a recognisable person. You cannot use any Content on or in conjunction with anything pornographic, obscene, offensive, illegal, immoral, infringing, defamatory, hateful, threatening or libellous in nature, or in breach of any law, regulation or industry code, or in any way which infringes the rights of any person or entity.

-You cannot use Content in a misleading or deceptive way. You cannot use Content in a way that is misleading or deceptive, including without limit: -by suggesting that any depicted person, brand, organization or other third party endorses or is affiliated with you or your goods or services, unless permission has been granted; or -by giving the impression that Content was created by you, or a person other than the intellectual property rights holder of the Content (including without limitation, by claiming or giving the impression that you hold ownership of, or exclusive rights to, the Content).
